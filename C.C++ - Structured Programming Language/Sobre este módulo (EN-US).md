### :page_facing_up: ABOUT  THIS MODULE

:calendar: **Study Date:** November 2021.

This module is about the learning space where I was introduced to learn **C/C++**. Despite the similarity with other languages, the C language has its particularities that require greater attention from the programmer, such as buffer issues.

> "This language is simpler than Java because it is a structured language (procedure-oriented) and not object-oriented (OOP), however, it is still a very present language due to several factors."
>
> In fact, this is the main difference between the C and C++ language.

**The main features of this language are:**

- *Portability;*
- *Efficient code generation;*
- *Simplicity;*
- *Reliability;*
- *Ease of use;*
- *Regularity.*

#### C Libraries

A differential of this language **in addition to its facility are the libraries, which in this case are three main ones:

- ***stdio.h:** contains standard input and output functions such as printf;*
- ***math.h:** contains math functions such as cos and log;*
- ***stdlib.h:** contains standard library functions such as exit, abort and sleep.*

> The inclusion of any library is done through the command: `#include <stdio.h>`

#### :man_teacher: **What did I learn in this module?**

 The C/C++ language, being older than Java, has fewer facilitators compared to a more modern language, which makes the task of developing complex programs even more difficult. However, also for the same reason, it is possible to find a much greater support on the internet and in forums about any problem that you have in this language, besides, of course, a lot of content that can be explored.
