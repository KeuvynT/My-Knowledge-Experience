### :page_facing_up: ABOUT THIS MODULE

:calendar: **Study Date:** September 2017.

This module is about the learning space where I was introduced to learn **HTML** . Different from other modules in which I learned certain languages during the **System Analysis and Development** college with exercises and the like. This language I learned autonomously through an internet course to understand **how to build WEB pages with HTML**.

`The knowledge learned was synthesized and organized into 8 folders (each folder refers to a class and a theme), the folder name points to the content studied and each folder has more notes on the topic studied.`

At the end of the course I set out to **build a WEB page with HTML applying all the knowledge** **acquired** **during the 12 classes for fixation.**

**You can check the result in the folder:** :open_file_folder: Final Challenge/Screenshots.
