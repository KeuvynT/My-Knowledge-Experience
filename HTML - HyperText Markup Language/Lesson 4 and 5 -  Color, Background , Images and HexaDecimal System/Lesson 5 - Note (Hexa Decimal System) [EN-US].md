#### <u>**LESSON NOTES - HEXADECIMAL SYSTEM**</u>

##### Composition of Hexa Decimals

- Formed by 6 digits, the first two numbers symbolize the amount of red, the middle two the amount of green, and the last two the amount of blue.

  > *From here we understand the meaning of the acronym RGB, which in full will be Red+Green+Blue.*

- The notation is given from smallest to largest as follows:

  - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F;


##### Creating Hexa Decimal Colors

Therefore, with this acquired knowledge it is possible to create our own hexadecimal colors taking into account the amount of red, green or blue that we want to use.

> **#FF0000** : Maximum Red;
> **#00FF00** : Maximum Green;
> **#0000FF** : Maximum Blue.
