### :page_facing_up:  ABOUT THIS MODULE 

This module is the learning space where I was introduced to learn **JAVA**. In each file, in addition to its own name, you can check through the synthesis for more information about the algorithm's objective.

:file_folder: **Exercises Performed**: Here you will find all the activities I did during college, it includes different types of activities, they are:

* :page_facing_up: **Activity:** These algorithms refer to the activities proposed during the studies.

* :page_facing_up: **Exercise:** These algorithms refer to activities proposed by me to fix the content.

* :file_folder: **Classes/Methods:** Here you will find algorithms and methods that I developed to carry out the proposed activities and also to simplify some processes in the construction of the algorithms.

* :open_file_folder:**FinalWork:** This folder is a simple program composed of a set of classes that work together to constitute the function of **Employee Registration** and **Withdrawal of Income Tax Statement**. It was the final work proposed to complete the module, in all, composed of 8 classes java.* 

  > For more information, you can consult a summary in the **Main.java** file.

#### :man_teacher: **What did I learn in this module?** 

The JAVA programming language was the first language that I had contact with a new way of programming, at first, I only knew the **Structured Programming** method that consisted of:

> * **Sequences:** Commands to be executed.
>
> * **Conditions:** Sequences that should only be executed if a condition is satisfied (examples: if, else, switch etc).
>
> * **Repetitions:** Sequences that must be executed repeatedly until a condition is satisfied (examples: for, while, do-while, etc).
>

But in this module we were introduced to a more modern, complex and challenging way.

<u>**The Modern Programming**</u>

**OOP (Object Oriented Programming)**, is a way of programming that modern languages such as **C#, Python** use. In addition to learning how to transform real-world elements in classes, objects and methods. I understood that this model consists of 3 fundamental pillars, they are:

> **Encapsulation:** It is the process of hiding all the details of an object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics. In short, it is widely used in the construction of methods and attributes.
>
> **Inheritance:** Allows the creation of a new class from an existing one called subclasses. Subclasses are derived from a superclass, where, in this type of relationship, the subclass inherits the attributes and methods from which it derives.
>
> **Polymorphism:** It is the principle by which two or more classes derived from the same superclass can invoke methods that have the same identification (signature), but with different behaviors, specialized for each derived class, using a reference to an object of the superclass type.
