### :page_facing_up:  ABOUT THIS MODULE

This module is the learning space where I was introduced to learn **Programming Algorithms**. Here you can find some of the exercises I developed while learning.

The program we use to learn was developed by students from the [Catholic University of Brasília (UCB)](https://ucb.catolica.edu.br/portal/), where I also obtained the privilege to attend **Analysis and Development of Systems**.

So this was my first steps in the world of programming. To conclude, I will add here the description provided by the faculty about the program we use, **CALANGO**.
